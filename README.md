# Little Lemon Capstone Project

## 📚 Project Overview

The Capstone project represents the final step in my Meta Front-End Developer Certificate program, designed to consolidate and showcase the skills acquired throughout the course. This project involved building a fully functional, real-world web application—the Little Lemon table booking system—using modern front-end technologies and best practices.

## 🎨 UI Prototype

Initial wireframes and prototypes were created in Figma during the Meta UX/UI Design course.

## 🛠 What I Did

- **React Refresher & Foundations:** I began the project with a brief recap of core React concepts covered earlier in the course, ensuring a solid foundation.
- **Semantic HTML & SEO Optimization:** I structured the application using semantic HTML5 elements, incorporated meta tags, and implemented Open Graph protocol to enhance SEO and social media sharing.
- **Responsive Design with CSS:** Using CSS Grid and other modern styling techniques, I created a clean, responsive, and user-friendly layout adaptable to different devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive Booking System:** I coded a dynamic table reservation system with React, implementing state management and navigation using React Router and React Hooks.
- **Form Validation & UX:** I ensured form inputs are validated properly, enhancing user experience and preventing errors.
- **Accessibility & Usability:** I applied accessibility best practices to make the application usable by all users, including those with disabilities. I also performed UX and UI usability evaluations to refine the interface.
- **Testing:** I wrote unit tests to verify key functionalities and improve code reliability.
- **Project Review:** I conducted a thorough self-assessment and participated in peer reviews, focusing on usability, accessibility, design quality, and code maintainability.

## 🚀 Outcome

This Capstone project allowed me to integrate all my front-end development knowledge into a single, comprehensive application. It stands as a job-ready portfolio piece that demonstrates my ability to solve practical problems using React and related web technologies.

## 🧩 Course Context

This project is the culmination of the Meta Front-End Developer Certificate program, combining everything I’ve learned in previous modules with practical application and guided development to ensure readiness for professional front-end development roles.
