# Little Lemon Capstone Project

## üìö Project Overview

The Capstone project represents the final milestone of my Meta Front-End Developer Certificate program, designed to consolidate and showcase the skills acquired throughout the course. This project involved developing a fully functional, real-world web application‚Äîthe Little Lemon table booking system‚Äîleveraging modern front-end technologies and best practices.

## üé® UI Prototype

Initial wireframes and interactive prototypes were designed in Figma as part of the Meta "Principles of UX/UI Design" course.

## üõ† What I Did

- **React Refresher & Foundations:** Began the project with a concise review of core React concepts covered earlier in the course to ensure a solid development foundation.  
- **Semantic HTML & SEO Optimization:** Structured the application using semantic HTML5 elements, integrated meta tags, and implemented Open Graph protocol to optimize SEO and social media sharing.  
- **Responsive Design with CSS:** Utilized CSS Grid and other modern styling techniques to create a clean, responsive, and user-friendly layout adaptable across devices and screen sizes.  
- **Interactive Booking System:** Developed a dynamic table reservation system with React, implementing state management and navigation via React Router and React Hooks.  
- **Form Validation & User Experience:** Implemented robust form validation to enhance user experience and prevent errors during input.  
- **Accessibility & Usability:** Applied accessibility best practices to ensure the application is usable by all users, including those with disabilities, alongside conducting UX/UI evaluations to refine the interface.  
- **Testing:** Authored unit tests to verify critical functionalities and improve code reliability.  
- **Project Review:** Conducted comprehensive self-assessment and participated in peer reviews focusing on usability, accessibility, design quality, and code maintainability.

## üöÄ Outcome

This Capstone project enabled me to synthesize my front-end development knowledge into a comprehensive, production-ready application. It serves as a portfolio piece that demonstrates my capability to solve practical problems using React and associated web technologies.

## üß© Course Context

This project marks the culmination of the Meta Front-End Developer Certificate program, integrating the skills and knowledge acquired in prior modules through practical application and guided development, preparing me for professional front-end development roles.
