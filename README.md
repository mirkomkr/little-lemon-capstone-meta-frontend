# Little Lemon Capstone Project

This repository contains the **Capstone project** for the **Meta Front-End Developer Certificate**.

## 📚 About the Project

The Capstone project is designed to simulate a real-world development scenario where front-end skills are applied to solve an authentic business problem. Throughout this project, I integrated the core technologies and practices learned during the program — including **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, and responsive design — to build a fully functional, user-friendly web application.

The application developed here represents the culmination of months of learning and hands-on practice, serving as both a test and showcase of my capabilities as a front-end developer.

## 🛠 Skills & Technologies Demonstrated

- Semantic HTML5 and responsive CSS
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Component-based architecture with React
- React Router for navigation
- React Hooks for state and side-effect management
- Controlled forms and input validation
- Modular, maintainable, and readable code
- Git version control and GitHub collaboration

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Solve a realistic, end-to-end front-end development challenge
- Apply best practices in React development
- Demonstrate full knowledge of the course curriculum
- Create a **job-ready portfolio project** to share with recruiters and potential employers

## 🧩 Course Context

This project wraps up the Meta Front-End Developer Certificate program, bringing together all the core competencies developed in previous modules. The Capstone includes content reviews and guided development to ensure successful completion and readiness for the job market.

> 💡 This project was built independently as part of the course requirements and is intended to highlight professional-level front-end development skills.
